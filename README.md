**THIS REPO IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

If anyone from AAU wants to continue development, send me an email. For non-AAU development I would suggest creating a fork of this repository.

# Aalborg University Discord Bot

<a href="https://discord.gg/JfGRgpg"><img src="https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/394918256734896128/embed.png" alt="" /></a>

This bot is made for the unofficial Aalborg University discord server.

## Documentation

#### Verification

In the `#verify-me` channel on discord you can write `!verify`. The bot will respond to that command with a randomly generated passphrase. In order to verify that you are a student at Aalborg University you need to send an email to aau@ludvig.xyz from your Aalborg University email, that email should _only_ contain the passphrase the bot gave you. After you have sent the email you should now be a verified user on the discord server.

#### Study programmes

Once verified, a user can use the `#assign-me` channel to assign themselves to their study programme using the `!assign [study programme]` command.
